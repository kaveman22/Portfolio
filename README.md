Portfolio Website for Kyle McDonald

  Hi I'm Kyle, Welcome to my personal portfolio! I put this site together to show a few of the hallmark
  applications that I feel best represent my work and understanding of technology. I am by in large a self 
  taught programmer, I am a University of Arizona Alumni with a Bachelors in Systems and Computer Engieering.
  I have a knack for learning new technology and creative problem solving.
  
  Although I do have experience in front-end development with React JS,
  the majority of my experience is with Python and back-end development. I have a passion for solving real world problems 
  with software and I derive much of my enjoyment in the creative problem solving process.
